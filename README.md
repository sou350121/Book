This is a collection of solutions to selected exercises from  __Learning Scientific Programming with Python__ 
by Christian Hill February 2016.




As what you can see form the description of this repository,
this file is aiming to code and solve the problems behind each 
cheater from the book "Learning_Scientific_Programming_with_Python".

Also, for examples inside some charter, I also reprecated the original code, and probably 
edited some of them that you may need to notice. But I sure that it is still functional well. 

Due to lack of time for finishing all the problems, what I could do 
is to pick some short questions as exercise,and most of them are shown
in here already. 

__Welcome to share your idea, perspective, and coding here!!__
