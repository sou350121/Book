Book's name :  Learning_Scientific_Programming_with_Pytho .

The Author of the book : Christian Hill.

As what you can see form the description of this repository,
this file is aiming to code and solve the problems behind each 
cheater from the book "Learning_Scientific_Programming_with_Python".

Due to lack of time for finishing all the problems, what I could do 
is to pick some short questions as exercise,and most of them are shown
in here already. 

Welcome to share your idea, perspective, and coding here!!
